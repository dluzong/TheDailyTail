# TheDailyTail 🐾

Fall '25 Capstone Project

## About

The Daily Tail is a centralized, cross-platform mobile application that brings together dog and cat owners, fosters, adoption centers, and rescue organizations onto a single platform! Our app allows users to manage multiple pets by tracking medications, meals, appointments, and other important events. In addition to pet management tools, The Daily Tail features a community board where users can connect and socialize, as well as organization pages that allow shelters and rescue groups to share updates and important information. Users can join these organizations to stay informed, making The Daily Tail both a pet care management tool and a community-driven resource.

## Features

- Dashboard with quick pet overview and recent activity
- Community board with global feed and organiztion specific feeds

## Getting Started

This project uses Flutter; make sure you have Flutter and Dart installed.

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Flutter and Dart SDK
- An editor such as VS Code or Android Studio
- For iOS development: Xcode (macOS only)
- For Android development: Android SDK (via Android Studio)

Run `flutter doctor` to verify your environment. Fix any issues the doctor reports before continuing.

### Clone the repository

Open a terminal and run:

```
git clone https://github.com/dluzong/TheDailyTail.git
cd frontend
```

### Environment file

Add a `.env` file in the `frontend/` folder **(.env file will be emailed upon request)**. Our app will not successfully run without it.

### Install dependencies

Install Dart/Flutter packages and CocoaPods (iOS) if needed:

```
flutter pub get
```

### Run the app

- Launch on an Android emulator, iOS simulator, or connected device

```
flutter run
```

<!-- 
```bash
flutter devices    # list available devices
flutter run -d <device-id>
``` -->

<!-- - To run on a specific platform:

```bash
# Android
flutter run -d android

# iOS (macOS only)
flutter run -d ios

# macOS desktop (if enabled)
flutter run -d macos
``` -->

## Troubleshooting

- If CocoaPods warns about platform or base configurations: open `ios/Podfile` and ensure `platform :ios, '13.0'` is set, then run `pod install` in `ios/`.
- If you see merge conflicts in `ios/Podfile.lock`, resolve the conflict, then run `pod install` and commit the resolved file.
- If you run into build or dependency errors, run `flutter clean` to clear out cache and rebuild the app.
